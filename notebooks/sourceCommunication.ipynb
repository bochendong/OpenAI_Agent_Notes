      "Based on my previous analysis, **this is a financial mathematics problem involving annuities and continuous compounding.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here’s why:**\n",
      "- **Annual deposits are made:** This makes it an annuity problem (repeated, periodic payments).\n",
      "- **Account pays 6% interest, compounded continuously:** This means you should use the formula for continuous compounding.\n",
      "- **Asked for balance right after and right before the 5th deposit:** This asks about the value of the account at specific, discrete points in time related to the sequence of deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Mathematical Principles Involved:\n",
      "- **Series of cash flows** (annuity): You are summing up the future value of each deposit, each of which grows at a continuously compounded rate from the time it was deposited until the present.\n",
      "- **Continuous compounding formula:** \\(A = Pe^{rt}\\) for future value.\n",
      "- **Geometric series:** The recurring deposits and their growth create a geometric series.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Typical Steps:\n",
      "1. **Calculate how much each deposit grows:** Each year's deposit will have a different amount of time to accumulate interest.\n",
      "2. **Sum all deposits up to just before and just after the 5th deposit:** Before the deposit, only 4 deposits contribute. After, all 5 are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Example Formula for such a problem:\n",
      "- For \\(n\\) deposits of \\(P\\) each at interest rate \\(r\\),\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\text{Balance before the } n\\text{th deposit} = P \\frac{e^{r n} - 1}{e^r - 1}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "(adjusted for the compounding, number of periods, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "This is an **annuity with continuous compounding problem** (often found in finance or applied calculus courses), requiring knowledge of series and the continuous compounding formula.\n"
